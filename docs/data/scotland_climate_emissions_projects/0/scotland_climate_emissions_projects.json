Street lighting electricity consumption has decreased by more than 30 % in the past 3 years and (by the end of the project) is projected to decrease by around 52% compared to the energy consumed in 2017/18.The budget for the street lighting LED replacement programme covers the full duration (3 years) and represents full costs including project management and the introduction of the new CMS (Content Management System). Carbon savings are directly dependent on the carbon intensity of the grid so these savings will decrease over time."

This will include completion of the Main Route Lantern Conversion Programme (due for completion by 2022), and small discrete capital schemes. The design life of the LED lanterns is guaranteed by the supplier for 12 years - minimising maintenance and repairs and increasing savings in costs and electricity consumption. Clacks have now appointed an MPAN Administrator who takes care of the Half Hourly billing of our Street Lighting electrical consumption. This will allow more accurate consumption and costs calculations for the future. Sign lighting upgrades are planned for future years capital programmes as the new guidance allows the removal of unnecessary sign lights and the upgrading of existing sodium lanterns to LED - again achieving savings in consumption and maintenance costs."

Examples of this programme of work include the following:\n\n1) The rewiring and Electrical upgrading of the stairwell lighting  and Emergency lighting in the Kilncraigs building\n\nThis Is the replacement of 63x28w circular fittings with more efficient 16w LED fittings and the fitting of 8x 3w exit boxes replacing the existing 8w ones. Energy savings are as follows\n\nExisting system  total = 1828w\nNew system       total =  1152w  \nSaving = 675w\n\nCost of Installation is \u00a316,268.00\nSaving in yearly testing costs = \u00a3 1,262.38 per year.\nThere will also be a substantial saving in the maintenance cost of these lights because these units are guaranteed for three years so they will require less frequent replacement.\n\n\n\n2) The Installation of a full new external Lighting system at Johnston court In Alva Involved the replacement of old 28w circular bulkheads with more efficient 16w LED circular bulkheads\nExisting system 38x28w total = 896w\nNew system 38x16w total = 608w saving of 288w\nCost of the Installation \u00a35743.00\nThis system Is covered by a manufacturers 3 year guarantee so the maintenance cost compared to the old system is far better and the system Is more efficient.\n\n3) The replacement of all external lighting at Marchside court with more efficient LED lighting. This Involved the replacement of old 28w circular bulkhead fitting with more efficient 16w LED fittings. The energy saving are as follows:\nExisting system 8x28w total = 224w\nNew system      8x16w total = 128w \nSaving of 96w\n      \nCost of Installing  \u00a3 256.00\nThis system Is covered by  a manufacturers 3 year Guarantee so the maintenance cost compared to the existing system is greatly reduced.\n\n4) The upgrade of Emergency Lighting- within Menstrie OPH this lighting failed the recent testing programme so we have taken this work in house and decided to replace all the old units with more efficient self testing LED units which will also reduce future testing costs. The saving are as follows:\nExisting system 65x 8w units total = 520w\nExit Boxes   6x8w    total = 48w\n\nNew system     65x3w units total = 186w\nExit boxes   6x3w          total = 18w \nsaving of 364w\n\n      Cost of units = \u00a3 1423.75\nThe saving forecast on the testing alone is \u00a31,173.48 per year so the units will pay for themselves In less than 2 years.\n \n5) Alloa Family Centre Upgrade of emergency lighting following testing.  Is We have taken this work In house and have  decided to Install  more efficient self test units with a view to also reducing further testing costs and maintenance issues.
