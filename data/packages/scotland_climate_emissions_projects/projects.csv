December 2021. Street lighting electricity consumption has decreased by more than 30 % in the past 3 years and (by the end of the project) is projected to decrease by around 52% compared to the energy consumed in 2017/18.The budget for the street lighting LED replacement programme covers the full duration (3 years) and represents full costs including project management and the introduction of the new CMS (Content Management System).

This will include completion of the Main Route Lantern Conversion Programme (due for completion by 2022), and small discrete capital schemes. The design life of the LED lanterns is guaranteed by the supplier for 12 years - minimising maintenance and repairs and increasing savings in costs and electricity consumption. Clacks have now appointed an MPAN Administrator who takes care of the Half Hourly billing of our Street Lighting electrical consumption. This will allow more accurate consumption and costs calculations for the future. Sign lighting upgrades are planned for future years capital programmes as the new guidance allows the removal of unnecessary sign lights and the upgrading of existing sodium lanterns to LED - again achieving savings in consumption and maintenance costs."

We have been able to remove older dirty diesel driven vehicles and replace them with the electric alternatives; this in turn has led to a reduction in fuel usage and an overall reduction in exhaust gases being released into the atmosphere.

The increase in electric vehicle in the fleet in 20/21 will have led to estimated carbon saving of 9.2Tonnes of CO2.

Work is on-going to identify areas of fleet that can easily be moved to electric / alternative fuelled vehicles.  We have seen investment in hybrid technology in the fleet and all vehicles purchased that are not electric or hybrid variants are bought with the latest Euro Emissions standards for Diesel fuelled vehicles. Investment in alternative fuels for diesel driven vehicles is also be considered to further reduce vehicle borne C02 levels across the fleet.

upgrades
– lighting/insulation/
glazing",,,Capital,,,,,2019/20,"This programme is making our schools and public buildings more energy efficient and in the process contributing towards lower carbon emissions. Examples of this programme of work include the following:

1) The rewiring and Electrical upgrading of the stairwell lighting  and Emergency lighting in the Kilncraigs building

This Is the replacement of 63x28w circular fittings with more efficient 16w LED fittings and the fitting of 8x 3w exit boxes replacing the existing 8w ones. Energy savings are as follows

Existing system  total = 1828w
New system       total =  1152w  
Saving = 675w

Cost of Installation is £16,268.00
Saving in yearly testing costs = £ 1,262.38 per year.
There will also be a substantial saving in the maintenance cost of these lights because these units are guaranteed for three years so they will require less frequent replacement.



2) The Installation of a full new external Lighting system at Johnston court In Alva Involved the replacement of old 28w circular bulkheads with more efficient 16w LED circular bulkheads
Existing system 38x28w total = 896w
New system 38x16w total = 608w saving of 288w
Cost of the Installation £5743.00
This system Is covered by a manufacturers 3 year guarantee so the maintenance cost compared to the old system is far better and the system Is more efficient.

3) The replacement of all external lighting at Marchside court with more efficient LED lighting. This Involved the replacement of old 28w circular bulkhead fitting with more efficient 16w LED fittings. The energy saving are as follows:
Existing system 8x28w total = 224w
New system      8x16w total = 128w 
Saving of 96w
      
Cost of Installing  £ 256.00
This system Is covered by  a manufacturers 3 year Guarantee so the maintenance cost compared to the existing system is greatly reduced.

4) The upgrade of Emergency Lighting- within Menstrie OPH this lighting failed the recent testing programme so we have taken this work in house and decided to replace all the old units with more efficient self testing LED units which will also reduce future testing costs. The saving are as follows:
Existing system 65x 8w units total = 520w
Exit Boxes   6x8w    total = 48w

New system     65x3w units total = 186w
Exit boxes   6x3w          total = 18w 
saving of 364w

      Cost of units = £ 1423.75
The saving forecast on the testing alone is £1,173.48 per year so the units will pay for themselves In less than 2 years.
 
5) Alloa Family Centre Upgrade of emergency lighting following testing.  Is We have taken this work In house and have  decided to Install  more efficient self test units with a view to also reducing further testing costs and maintenance issues. The cost and energy saving are as follows:
Existing system 30x38w units total = 240w
Old 600x600 tubed panels 13x120w =1560w

New system 30x3w units total= 90w
600x600 LED panels 13x60w = 780w 
saving of 930w

Cost of replacement units £1,095.90
The savings forecast on saving on testing alone Is £764.54 per year so the  units pay for themselves in less than 2 years.

6) Menstrie PS upgrade of emergency lighting system following testing to LED self testing units reducing energy and maintenance costs the saving were as follows:
Existing system:
 20x28w circular bulkheads total = 560w
17x8w   rectangular bulkheads =  136w
New system:
 20x16w LED circular bulkheads   = 320w
17x3w   Led  Bulkheads =51w

Saving 325w
  Cost of replacement units £962.15
   The yearly savings forecast on testing alone £ 657.86. so the new units pay for themselves in less than 2 years.

7) Marshill House  upgrade to emergency lights following testing to self testing LED units and energy savings are as follows

   Existing lights 15x8w bulkheads total = 120w
   New system    15x3wbulkheads total =  45w saving 75w
   Cost of units  £284.25
   Savings forecast from testing alone = £266.70 per year
   New units will pay for themselves In less than 2 years.

8)  Banchory PS upgrade to lighting following emergency lighting. Testing this work will be carried out in house and changed to more efficient LED lighting. The energy and testing savings are as follows:
   Existing lights 16x8w bulkheads total = 128w
   Replacement  16x3w bulkheads total = 48w saving 80w
   Cost of units £303.20
   Savings forecast on testing alone  £284.48
   New units pay for themselves in less than 2 years

When this project has been completed, it is expected that savings in consumption will be over 53% and in terms of kWh it will save 29,743 kWh. With this building having long opening hours including at weeknds, this is a significant reduction in a highly used facility. "
